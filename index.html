        <h3 class="text-center">Chicken</h3>
        <p class="text-left">Chicken in the United States is a cheap and readily available meat. It is packed in a variety of formats, from whole roasting chickens to selections of one particular cut, such as thighs or wings. Highly automated, large-scale chicken farming and processing complexes run by large corporations fuel the American chicken market. The development of so-called factory farming sharply reduced the price and increased the availability of chicken, when this method was introduced in the 1920s.The ancestor of today's domestic chicken is the wild red jungle fowl Gallus gallus, native to India and Southeast Asia. The red jungle fowl was first domesticated apparently for use in religious rituals involving cockfighting. The domesticated bird spread west-ward from India to Greece, and was later introduced to Western Europe by invading Roman armies. By the Roman era, chickens were used as food, both for their meat and for their eggs. Romans commonly carried them on their ships, as a convenient source of fresh food.

The first European settlers in North America brought chickens with them. But until the twentieth century, there was no chicken industry as such in this country. Care of the chicken flock was for the most part considered work for women and children. At that time, a typical hen laid only 30 eggs a year, and farm wives sold their excess at market as supplemental income. Chicken meat was usually only plentiful in the early summer, when chickens that had hatched in the spring were big enough to eat. Because chicken husbandry was primarily women's work, only as an adjunct to the major farm production, distribution channels were limited. Whereas railroads were built to bring cattle from the West to waiting urban markets, no such effort was put into chicken production, and chicken was available in cities more or less sporadically, with large seasonal jumps in prices and amount of supply.

Several inventors perfected chicken incubators in the late nineteenth century. These machines could keep hundreds of eggs at a time warm, and so made possible commercial breeding of chicks. In the nineteenth century, breeding of chickens was mostly a hobby, with many poultry enthusiasts raising fabulously feathered chickens. Showy and colorful exotic breeds were the most popular; however, with the advent of mechanical incubators, poultry breeders began to breed birds with good egg-laying and meat production potential.

The first person in the United States to raise broiler chickens (chickens for meat) on a large scale strictly for profit was a Mrs. Wilmer Steele, of Ocean View, Delaware. In 1923, Mrs. Steele bought 500 chicks and sold the surviving 387 of them when they matured to 2 lb (0.9 kg). Her profit was enormous, and within just a few years, Delaware became the center of a thriving chicken industry. In 1926, the state produced around one million broiler chickens.

By 1934, it was raising about seven million chickens annually. In the 1930s, the National Poultry Improvement Plan, a federal-state cooperative mission, helped chicken farmers use scientific breeding principles to produce superior strains of birds. At this time, birds were first bred specifically for meat production. The important qualities of broiler chickens were rapid growth, white feathers (dark feathers left unsightly stubs), and meaty breasts and thighs. The advances in breeding made quite an impact: in 1900, a typical chick took 16 weeks to reach 2 lb (0.9 kg), which was considered frying weight. Today, a commercial broiler chicken lives only about six weeks, and weighs about 4 lb (1.8 kg) at slaughter.

Advances in nutrition were also important to the development of a commercial chicken industry. Chicken nutrition has actually been studied more, and is better understood, than human nutrition. The combined efforts of the feed industry, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and agricultural scientists led to optimum feed. The ratio of feed necessary per pound of chicken meat has fallen through this century, making chicken ever cheaper to produce. By the 1950s, several large companies had integrated feed production with chicken farming and meat processing, so that only a few large corporations controlled a high percentage of the chicken produced in this country. These major producers each slaughter millions of chickens a week.

A century ago, your typical chicken was really kind of scrawny. It took about four months to grow to a weight of 3 pounds. One result: Americans really didn't eat much chicken.

Today, the typical broiler, or meat chicken, turns feed into meat at a mind-boggling pace. Compared with the bird of yesteryear, it grows to twice the size in half the time. But some animal welfare advocates want the poultry industry to turn back the clock. Modern meat chickens are growing so fast, they say, that they are suffering.

William Muir, a poultry geneticist at Purdue University, says this transformation was mainly a triumph of chicken breeding. "This is what genetics does. We can actually make more from less," he says — more chicken meat from less feed, in less time.

It wasn't magic or genetic engineering. Muir says poultry breeders simply got their fastest-growing chickens to mate with each other, generation after generation. "We just breed the best to the best, and you get the best," Muir says.

The "best" chicken, for the past century, has been one that put on muscle quickly. But according to Muir, a trait that was great for the poultry industry turned out to be not so great for the chickens themselves.

All that weight, accumulated quickly, can overwhelm a young chicken's bones.

"We're having problems with legs," Muir says. "They can't support the weight. We have problems with splayed legs, joint problems. This is a major well-being concern, if the bird can't walk."

Studies have observed these problems in anywhere from 15 to 30 percent of chickens grown for their meat, known as broilers.

Broiler chickens are slaughtered when they're still young, but others are kept around in order to reproduce. They are the so-called breeder flocks — the source of the billions of chickens that people eat.

Because these chickens live longer, Muir says, they have a special problem. "They're so big and heavy, if we let them keep on eating, they couldn't reproduce. So they have to be on a diet, a severe diet, and they're always hungry."

For all those reasons, some animal welfare advocates have been calling on poultry companies to turn back the clock and return to slower-growing breeds of chickens.

Those breeds still do exist. Poultry producers can order them from the same big chicken-breeding companies that created the fast-growing chicken.

There's increasing demand for slower-growing breeds in Europe. In the U.S., they're mainly used by farmers who want to raise their chickens the old-fashioned way, running around outdoors.

Theo Weening, the global meat buyer for Whole Foods Market, says his stores do stock small quantities of such pastured poultry. "Actually, I'm on my way this afternoon to Arkansas, to Crystal Lake Farms, [which] uses a slow-growing chicken," he told The Salt.

Whole Foods recently announced that it wants all of its suppliers, even those raising large numbers of broilers indoors, to shift over to slower-growing breeds of chickens.

The shift will take eight years. Whole Foods and the Global Animal Partnership, an organization that Whole Foods set up to create welfare standards for its suppliers, say that this will apply to 277 million birds annually. That represents about 3 percent of the country's broilers.

The slow-growing bird "is a much better, healthier chicken, and at the same time it's a much [more] flavorful chicken as well," Weening says.

But he admits that this chicken will come with a cost. Slower-growing breeds consume more feed per pound of meat. According to data on the website of the poultry breeding company Aviagen, a slower-growing breed called Rowan Ranger consumes about 25 percent more feed while growing to a weight of 6 pounds than the Ross 308 breed, which the company says is the "world's most popular broiler."

After the Whole Foods announcement, the National Chicken Council, which represents major poultry producers, released a statement disputing the idea that faster-growing chickens are less healthy or are suffering.

The Chicken Council also pointed out the benefits of the industry's push for ever greater efficiency.

      <div id="beef" class="col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">
        <h3  class="text-center">Beef</h3>
        Beef is the culinary name for meat from cattle. Beef can be harvested from bulls, heifers or steers. Its acceptability as a food source varies in different parts of the world.

Beef muscle meat can be cut into roasts, short ribs or steak (filet mignon, sirloin steak, rump steak, rib steak, rib eye steak, hanger steak, etc.) Some cuts are processed (corned beef or beef jerky), and trimmings, usually mixed with meat from older, leaner cattle, are ground, minced or used in sausages. The blood is used in some varieties of blood sausage. Other parts that are eaten include the oxtail, liver, tongue, tripe from the reticulum or rumen, glands (particularly the pancreas and thymus, referred to as sweetbread), the heart, the brain (although forbidden where there is a danger of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, BSE), the kidneys, and the tender testicles of the bull (known in the United States as calf fries, prairie oysters, or Rocky Mountain oysters). Some intestines are cooked and eaten as-is, but are more often cleaned and used as natural sausage casings. The bones are used for making beef stock.

Beef from steers and heifers is very similar. According to the most recent National Beef Quality Audit, heifer carcasses had slightly more marbling than steer carcasses, but USDA quality grade was not significantly different.[1] Depending on economics, the number of heifers kept for breeding varies. The meat from older bulls is usually tougher, so it is frequently used for mince (known as ground beef in the United States). Cattle raised for beef may be allowed to roam free on grasslands, or may be confined at some stage in pens as part of a large feeding operation called a feedlot (or concentrated animal feeding operation), where they are usually fed a ration of grain, protein, roughage and a vitamin/mineral preblend.

Beef is the third most widely consumed meat in the world, accounting for about 25% of meat production worldwide, after pork and poultry at 38% and 30% respectively.[2] In absolute numbers, the United States, Brazil, and the People's Republic of China are the world's three largest consumers of beef; however, Uruguay has the highest beef and veal consumption per capita, followed by Argentina and Brazil. According to the data from OECD, the average Uruguayan ate over 42 kg (93 lb) of beef or veal in 2014, representing the highest beef/veal consumption per capita in the world. In comparison, the average American consumed only about 24 kg (53 lb) beef or veal in the same year, while African countries, such as Mozambique, Ghana, and Nigeria, consumed the least beef or veal per capita.

In 2014, the world's largest exporters of beef were Brazil, Australia and the United States, respectively.[3] Beef production is also important to the economies of Uruguay, Canada, Paraguay, Mexico, Argentina, Belarus and Nicaragua.

Meat is animal flesh that is eaten as food.[1]:1 Humans have hunted and killed animals for meat since prehistoric times. The advent of civilization allowed the domestication of animals such as chickens, sheep, pigs and cattle, and eventually their use in meat production on an industrial scale.

Meat is mainly composed of water, protein, and fat,[2] and is usually eaten together with other food. It is edible raw, but is normally eaten after it has been cooked and seasoned or processed in a variety of ways. Unprocessed meat will spoil or rot within hours or days as a result of infection with and decomposition by bacteria and fungi.

Most often, meat refers to skeletal muscle and associated fat and other tissues, but it may also describe other edible tissues such as offal.[1]:1 Meat is sometimes also used in a more restrictive sense – the flesh of mammalian species (pigs, cattle, lambs, etc.) raised and prepared for human consumption, to the exclusion of fish, other seafood, poultry or other animals.

The word meat comes from the Old English word mete, which referred to food in general. The term is related to mad in Danish, mat in Swedish and Norwegian, and matur in Icelandic and Faroese, which also mean 'food'. The word mete also exists in Old Frisian (and to a lesser extent, modern West Frisian) to denote important food, differentiating it from swiets (sweets) and dierfied (animal feed).

Paleontological evidence suggests that meat constituted a substantial proportion of the diet of even the earliest humans.[1]:2 Early hunter-gatherers depended on the organized hunting of large animals such as bison and deer.[1]:2

The domestication of animals, of which we have evidence dating back to the end of the last glacial period (c. 10,000 BC),[1]:2 allowed the systematic production of meat and the breeding of animals with a view to improving meat production.[1]:2 The animals which are now the principal sources of meat were domesticated in conjunction with the development of early civilizations:

A typical shoulder cut of lamb
Sheep, originating from western Asia, were domesticated with the help of dogs prior to the establishment of settled agriculture, likely as early as the 8th millennium BC.[1]:3 Several breeds of sheep were established in ancient Mesopotamia and Egypt by 3500–3000 BC.[1]:3 Presently, more than 200 sheep-breeds exist.
Cattle were domesticated in Mesopotamia after settled agriculture was established about 5000 BC,[1]:5 and several breeds were established by 2500 BC.[1]:6 Modern domesticated cattle fall into the groups Bos taurus (European cattle) and Bos indicus (zebu), both descended from the now-extinct aurochs.[1]:5 The breeding of beef cattle, cattle optimized for meat production as opposed to animals best suited for draught or dairy purposes, began in the middle of the 18th century.[1]:7

A Hereford bull, a breed of cattle frequently used in beef production.
Domestic pigs, which are descended from wild boars, are known to have existed about 2500 BC in modern-day Hungary and in Troy; earlier pottery from Jericho and Egypt depicts wild pigs.[1]:8 Pork sausages and hams were of great commercial importance in Greco-Roman times.[1]:8 Pigs continue to be bred intensively as they are being optimized to produce meat best suited for specific meat products.[1]:9
Other animals are or have been raised or hunted for their flesh. The type of meat consumed varies much between different cultures, changes over time, depending on factors such as tradition and the availability of the animals. The amount and kind of meat consumed also varies by income, both between countries and within a given country.[5]

Horses are commonly eaten in France,[6] Italy, Germany and Japan, among other countries.[7] Horses and other large mammals such as reindeer were hunted during the late Paleolithic in western Europe.[8]
Dogs are consumed in China,[9] South Korea[10] and Vietnam.[11] Dogs are also occasionally eaten in the Arctic regions.[12] Historically, dog meat has been consumed in various part of the world, such as Hawaii,[13] Japan,[14] Switzerland[15] and Mexico.[16]
Cats are consumed in Southern China and Peru.[17]
Guinea pigs are raised for their flesh in the Andes.[18]
Whales and dolphins are hunted, partly for their flesh, in Japan, Alaska, Siberia, Canada, the Faroe Islands, Greenland, Iceland, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and by two small communities in Indonesia.[19]
Modern agriculture employs a number of techniques, such as progeny testing, to speed artificial selection by breeding animals to rapidly acquire the qualities desired by meat producers.[1]:10 For instance, in the wake of well-publicised health concerns associated with saturated fats in the 1980s, the fat content of United Kingdom beef, pork and lamb fell from 20–26 percent to 4–8 percent within a few decades, due to both selective breeding for leanness and changed methods of butchery.[1]:10 Methods of genetic engineering aimed at improving the meat production qualities of animals are now also becoming available.[1]:14

Fresh meat in a supermarket in North America
Even though it is a very old industry, meat production continues to be shaped strongly by the evolving demands of customers. The trend towards selling meat in pre-packaged cuts has increased the demand for larger breeds of cattle, which are better suited to producing such cuts.[1]:11 Even more animals not previously exploited for their meat are now being farmed, especially the more agile and mobile species, whose muscles tend to be developed better than those of cattle, sheep or pigs. The end.

      <div id="sushi" class="col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">
        <h3  class="text-center">Sushi</h3>
        Scientists believe it is one of the reasons why the Japanese are among the most healthy people in the world.
On average, the Japanese diet - raw fish, vegetables and rice - contains only 30pc fat, most of it the healthier polyunsaturated variety, compared with 40pc in Britain.
As a result, their rates of heart disease are among the lowest in the world. Recently, scientists in Japan found that sushi dishes - flavoured parcels of rice with raw fish and vegetables - could even protect smokers against lung cancer.
Professor Toshiro Takezaki, who led the study, says: 'Japanese people love fresh fish, particularly sushi. We think that is why, even though the Japanese smoke as much as people in the UK, their rate of lung cancer is only two-thirds as high.'
The Cancer Research Campaign believes giving up smoking is the biggest preventive step, but says a high consumption of fresh fish and vegetables would lower the risk.
Here, Good Health gives a user's guide to the unique health-giving properties of sushi.
Raw fish:
On average, each person in Japan consumes around 100 grams of fish every day, in forms such as sushi, tempura and sashimi.
The omega-3 fatty acids in fish are linked to heart protection and improved circulation.
However, fish are host to many parasitic worms, and some must be cooked to make sure all worms and their eggs are killed.
Rice:
Rice is the staple of the Japanese diet. It is a good source of energy and provides a supply of protein. Long used by naturopaths to treat digestive disorders, it sometimes helps in relieving diarrhoea.
Highly refined white rice has fewer nutrients than brown. But brown rice contains phytic acid, which blocks the absorption of iron and calcium into the body.
Wasabi:
This is the green paste, often served with sushi, that is the Japanese equivalent of English mustard.
Thought to cleanse the palate, wasabi could also have health benefits. Scientists in Japan have discovered compounds called isothiocyanates in the paste that can help prevent tooth decay.
Wasabi has also been found to aid cancer prevention and prevent blood clots, if eaten regularly.
Seaweed:
The Japanese have been eating sea vegetables for centuries. They use seaweed in large amounts in their diet because of its concentrated mineral content.
Up to a quarter of Japanese food contains seaweed to boost flavour. In sushi, dried sheets are wrapped around rice and vegetables to form a mini-parcel.
It is rich in iodine - vital for a healthy thyroid - copper, calcium iron and magnesium.

Sushi (すし, 寿司, 鮨?) is a type of food preparation originating in Japan, consisting of cooked vinegared rice (鮨飯 sushi-meshi) combined with other ingredients (ネタ neta) such as raw seafood, vegetables and sometimes tropical fruits. Ingredients and forms of sushi presentation vary widely, but the ingredient which all sushi have in common is rice (also referred to as shari (しゃり) or sumeshi (酢飯)). Although commonly mistaken for sushi, sashimi, which is also a Japanese delicacy, consists of thinly sliced raw fish and may or may not be served with rice.

Sushi can be prepared with either brown or white rice. It is often prepared with raw seafood, but some common varieties of sushi use cooked ingredients and many are vegetarian. Sushi is often served with pickled ginger, wasabi, and soy sauce. Popular garnishes are often made using daikon.

The original type of sushi, known today as nare-zushi (馴れ寿司, 熟寿司,) was first made in Southeast Asia. Fish was salted and wrapped in fermented rice, a traditional lacto-fermented rice dish. Narezushi was made of this gutted fish which was stored in fermented rice for months at a time for preservation. The fermentation of the rice prevented the fish from spoiling.[1] The fermented rice was discarded and fish was the only part consumed. This early type of sushi became an important source of protein for the Japanese. The term sushi comes from an antiquated grammatical form no longer used in other contexts, and literally means "sour-tasting", a reflection of its historic origin as a fermented food. The oldest form of sushi in Japan, narezushi, is still made by wrapping fish in soured fermenting rice, which causes the fish proteins to break down into their constituent amino acids. The fermenting rice and fish have both a sour and an umami taste.[2]

Contemporary Japanese sushi has little resemblance to the traditional lacto-fermented rice dish. Originally, when the fermented fish was taken out of the rice, only the fish was consumed while the fermented rice was discarded.[3] The strong-tasting and smelling funazushi, a kind of narezushi made near Lake Biwa in Japan, resembles the traditional fermented dish. Beginning in the Muromachi period (1336–1573) of Japan, vinegar was added to the mixture for better taste and preservation. The vinegar accentuated the rice's sourness and was known to increase its shelf life, allowing the fermentation process to be shortened and eventually abandoned. In the following centuries, sushi in Osaka evolved into oshi-zushi. The seafood and rice were pressed using wooden (usually bamboo) molds. By the mid 18th century, this form of sushi had reached Edo (contemporary Tokyo).[4]

The contemporary version, internationally known as "sushi", was created by Hanaya Yohei (1799–1858) at the end of the Edo period in Edo. Sushi invented by Hanaya was an early form of fast food that was not fermented (therefore prepared quickly) and could be conveniently eaten with one's hands. The size of the previous sushi was about three times as large as contemporary ones.[4] Originally, this sushi was known as Edomae zushi because it used freshly caught fish in the Edo-mae (Edo Bay or Tokyo Bay). Though the fish used in modern sushi no longer usually comes from Tokyo Bay, it is still formally known as Edomae nigirizushi.[5][6]

The Oxford English Dictionary notes the earliest written mention of sushi in English in an 1893 book, A Japanese Interior, where it mentions sushi as "a roll of cold rice with fish, sea-weed, or some other flavoring".[7][8] However, there is also mention of sushi in a Japanese-English dictionary from 1873,[9] and an 1879 article on Japanese cookery in the journal Notes and Queries.
